I received my B.E. in Artificial Intelligence from [China University of Petroleum-Beijing](https://cup.edu.cn/) in July. 2023. And currently I am a third year Master Candidate from [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cup.edu.cn/cupai/), [China University of Petroleum-Beijing](https://cup.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Multimodal Generation and Understanding, Diffusion Model, Deep Learning, and Interpretable Models. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qiang Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m61aeIAAAAAJ&hl=en) of Beijing Key Laboratory of Petroleum Data Mining from [College of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cup.edu.cn/cupai/), China University of Petroleum-Beijing.
